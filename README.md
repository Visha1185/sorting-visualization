## 🎯 Purpose  

This project was created to:  
- Enhance my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** through practical implementation.  
- Help beginners in programming gain a better understanding of **sorting algorithms** by providing an interactive, visual representation of their behavior.  

By visually demonstrating how sorting algorithms work step by step, this tool serves as an educational resource for both students and enthusiasts.

## 📌 Supported Sorting Algorithms  

The application visualizes the following sorting algorithms:  

1. **Bubble Sort**  
2. **Insertion Sort**  
3. **Selection Sort**  
4. **Merge Sort**  
5. **Quick Sort**  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Step-by-step animations to show the inner workings of sorting algorithms.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design to make it easy for anyone to use.  
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Understand the differences in performance, time complexity, and space complexity of each algorithm.  
- **Responsive Design:** Accessible across devices, ensuring a seamless experience.  

---

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. Open the [live demo](https://sortinggvisualiserr.netlify.app/) in your browser.  
2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the options provided.  
3. Adjust the array size and speed using the controls.  
4. Click the "Sort" button to visualize the algorithm in action.
